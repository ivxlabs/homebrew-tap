  # The app carries no paid developer certificate, so Homebrew's own quarantine
  # flag is what Gatekeeper will complain about. Say so rather than stripping it
  # behind the user's back.
  caveats <<~EOS
    This build is not signed or notarised. On first launch macOS will refuse it.
    Either right-click the app and choose Open, or reinstall without the
    quarantine flag:

      brew install --cask --no-quarantine ivxai-chat
